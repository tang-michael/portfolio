          Hello! I'm Michael, currently a junior at <b id="color">Rutgers University - New Brunswick</b>. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in economics.

          I enjoy working on innovative technology whether that includes developing interactive websites or new software. That being said, I  have experience working
